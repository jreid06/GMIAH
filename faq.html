                                <p class="answer">You know how your family doctor sometimes has to refer you to a specialist? Well, think of us as the "specialist" when it comes to unusual estate situations. Estate agents can handle many straightforward home sales, but they have their rules and limits. If a family comes along that does not fit into those rules, then they say "Sorry, we can't help you."</p>
                            <p class="answer">Because we're the specialists in dealing with difficult credit problems, small down payments, and other issues, we pride ourselves in finding solutions when others just throw up their hands.</p>

Just as we solve problems for people that want to own homes, we do the same for those that need to sell. Sometimes a job transfer, divorce, or other situation causes people to want to sell their homes faster than what an estate agent can do. We can act very quickly, so we often get those houses.</p>

                                <p class="answer">This is the "best-kept secret" in America! We have a regular supply of nice homes where you can move in immediately. Then, while you enjoy the benefits of living there, you pay rent, a portion of which goes toward your eventual mortgage on the home.</p>
                                <p class="answer">Yes, you read that correctly: You get to move into a nice home; you pay rent while you fix your credit, or decide whether you want to buy the home; and a portion of your rent goes toward your mortgage.</p>
                                <p class="answer">Some of our plans even allow you to "lock in" today's purchase price for the home! That means you don't have to sweat whether home prices are growing faster than your ability to get a good mortgage.</p>

Because houses come in all sizes, and people have so many different situations, we don't have one set fee. But because we don't charge you any up-front "processing fee" or other such nonsense, we only earn our keep if we are able to put you in the house of your dreams. Furthermore, much of our fee is paid by the people who sold the home to us, so the portion you pay is more than fair.
